# Three-Stage Hybrid Recommendation System for Personalized Skincare

## Overview
This repository consists of a three-stage hybrid skincare recommendation system using product catalog from Chemist Warehouse and an ingredients database from Renud. The system integrates three stages of components: constraint-based filtering, semantic ranking using bi-encoder or cross-encoder, and neural network quality assessmen to deliver recommendations for single-product and multi-product (routine) scenarios. The process includes web scraping, data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model experimentation.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Input datasets used by the recommendation system.
- **skincare_recommendation_system_chemist_warehouse.ipynb**: The main notebook implementing the recommendation system.
