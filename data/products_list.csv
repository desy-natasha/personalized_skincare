Is a powerful antioxidant which boosts your skins defence systems. Numerous clinical trials have proven its ability to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and plump skin. It both protects and increases collagen production and brightens skin.    CHROMANOL
Chromanol is a molecule related to the tocopherol family which protects against both oxygen and nitrogen based free radicals. Nitrogen based free radicals are thought to be the major contributor to the formation of dark spots and pigmentation of the skin. Its antioxidant power is higher than vitamin C, Co Q10, idebenone, green tea, anthocyanin and just about any other antioxidant. Chromanol also provides a defence against UV rays and pollution — both major contributors to skin pigmentation.  COLLAGEN FRAGMENTS

It is  96% identical to human collagen, making it 100% vegan and more sustainable to bovine, fish or plant collagen.

It leaves the skin feeling calm, smooth, and dewy.

GOJI STEM CELLS

PhytoCellTec™ Goji revitalizes mesenchymal stem cells and boosts their exosome production. This results in the improved production of extracellular matrix components such as collagen and elastin by fibroblasts. (Fibroblasts synthesize collagen and extracellular matrix components and function in building and repairing the structural components of the skin.)

SODIUM HYALURONATE: (This is a low molecular extract to HA)

Low molecular weight hyaluronic acid works from the epidermis to keep skin feeling plump and hydrated. Because this works from deep in the skin it quickly hydrates the epidermis and helps improves cell vitality. Sodium hyaluronate is the salt form of HA and is a water-soluble salt that holds 1000 times its weight in water.

“Sodium hyaluronate is a derivative of HA — specifically, it’s a salt form of HA. Sodium hyaluronate has a lower molecular weight than HA and hydrolyzed HA, so it’s more easily absorbed into pores. “Sodium hyaluronate has the ability to penetrate into deeper layers of the skin, and also attracts and binds water. This effect can plump the skin, thus reducing the look of wrinkles and making skin younger-looking. Sodium hyaluronate is hydrophilic, meaning it easily mixes with water. When applied topically, it attracts moisture in skin cells. This reduces dryness and flaking by increasing skin hydration. Compared to high molecular weight HA, sodium hyaluronate can provide a greater hydrating effect at a deeper level in our skin. Sodium hyaluronate is a water-soluble salt form of hyaluronic acid created by scientists to increase stability and lessen the likelihood of oxidization. The two names (hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate) are used interchangeably in the beauty industry, but they do have their differences.

AHAs may make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Now, more than ever, it is essential to guard your youthful skin. Elucent Anti-Ageing Day Moisturiser contains an SPF 30 broad-spectrum sunscreen to help protect against UVA & UVB radiation while the AHAs continue to work on helping to improve the appearance of the skin. Protect your skin by avoiding prolonged sun exposure. Do not stay too long in the sun, even while using a sunscreen product.

Made with oat extract and ultra-hydrating lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Deep Restore Body Lotion helps keep your skin looking healthy and moisturised - for a difference you can feel. Daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity and sun) can cause your skin's natural moisture barrier to break down, allowing water to escape the skin. But the ultra-hydrating lipids in our Deep Restore lotion fortify the skin barrier and replenish moisture, allowing your skin's natural barrier to recover. This body moisturiser is clinically tested to provide 90% more moisture (vs untreated skin). It absorbs fast without leaving any residue or greasy feel, delivering the nourishing care your skin craves. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion daily on dry and rough skin to leave it stronger and noticeably healthier looking. Simply apply to your skin, preferably after a shower, and enjoy up to 48 hours of moisture. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made from 50% recycled plastic. Vaseline has a range of moisturisers to help restore, soothe and nourish all skin types. We believe skin care is essential for well-being. That's why Vaseline is working towards giving everybody, everywhere, access to the skin care they need. Visit our website to learn more about our global partnership with Direct Relief.

Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Original 100g,$5.99,4.8,132,"Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Original 100 g
Vaseline Petroleum Jelly is the original wonder jelly. Perfect for both skin care and lip care, not only is it clinically proven to help restore dry skin, but it can also be used as an effective lip balm, helping relieve chapped lips by replenishing moisture.
Made of 100% pure petroleum jelly, Vaseline is triple purified to ensure that it's gentle on your skin, hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic (won't clog your pores). It makes a soothing dressing for nappy rash, chafing, sore lips, minor burns, cuts and rough hands. Moreover, it protects your skin from windburn and chapping and helps reduce the appearance of fine, dry lines.
Vaseline literally melts into the skin, flowing into the tiny cracks caused by dryness where moisture is needed most. That's why Vaseline acts as a powerful skin moisturiser, providing a barrier against water loss from already dry skin and helping protect against the effects of weather and exposure.
Vaseline believes that truly healthy skin starts with deep moisture. It’s not something you get by masking problems or using quick fixes. As the original skin experts, we've been safely helping care for skin for over 140 years. It is our goal to make the original, triple-purified Vaseline Petroleum the core of every product because there is no jelly with a longer history of locking in moisture to strengthen skin barrier and protect dry skin.

St Ives captures the secrets of naturally beautiful skin in this deep cleansing formula that gently exfoliates, cleaning pores and helps to stop breakouts before they occur. Apricots are known to contain one of the highest levels of carotenoids (think vitamin A) and super-effective antioxidants. All of this natural power might seem, well, too powerful, but they are actually quite gentle and nourishing, and they help make fresher, more nourished skin beautifully possible. Walnut is known for its hard shell, but when it's ground, it becomes an amazingly effective, all-natural exfoliant ingredient in our facial scrubs. Not only are walnuts plentiful on the planet, they also help newer, healthier skin come to the surface. For best results: Moisten face with water. Dispense product onto fingertips and massage over face. Rinse with water. Avoid direct contact with eyes. In case of contact with eyes, flush thoroughly with water. For best results, use 3 to 4 times per week. St. Ives believes nature has the power to soothe, heal, awaken and energise. Above all, we respect the natural world as a vibrant source of energy and life and are just as committed to bringing you its power. Because we believe in and harness the power of nature, we deliver products that work. We formulate with renewable ingredients whenever possible, and make nature's power work for is - without sacrificing effectiveness.

A soothing dressing for: nappy rash, chafing, sore lips, minor burns, cuts and rough hands. Protects your skin from windburn and chapping and helps reduce the appearance of fine, dry lines on your skin. Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly is the original wonder jelly. Vaseline has long been used to manage symptoms of many severe skin conditions. It literally melts into the skin, flowing into the tiny cracks caused by dryness where moisture is needed most. In this way Vaseline acts as an extremely powerful skin moisturiser to provide a barrier against water loss from already dry skin and help protect against the effects of weather and exposure. Our petroleum jelly is triple-purified to be 100% pure. Vaseline® believes that truly healthy skin starts with deep moisture. It's not something you get by masking problems or through quick fixes. We know this because we are the original skin experts. Founded in 1870 by Robert Chesebrough, Vaseline® has been safely helping care for skin for over 140 years. It is our goal to make the original, triple-purified Vaseline Petroleum Jelly the core of every product because there is no jelly with a longer history of locking in moisture to strengthen skin barrier and protect dry skin.

LeQure Detox Spray 100ml,$9.99,4.8,4,"The Detox spray combines the healing powers of Fulvic & Humic Acid that is not currently in ANY other beauty products on the market, with the amazing benefits of magnesium and juniper oils.
WHAT IS FULVIC ACID?
Fulvic acid is a component of soil and is released as organic matter decomposes. Fulvic acid is considered one of the most chemically active compounds as it contains a variety of beneficial nutrients. The compound contains an assortment of hormones, fatty acids, ketones, flavonoids, and vitamins and minerals.
HOW IT WORKS
One of the most powerful natural free radical scavengers & antioxidants known.
One of nature's most powerful organic electrolytes.
Stimulates metabolism
Enhances nutrients; Fulvic acid enhances the availability of nutrients and makes them more readily absorbable.
Transports nutrients; Fulvic acid readily complexes with minerals and metals making them available and easily absorbable through cell walls. It makes minerals such as iron, which are usually not very mobile, easily transported.
MAGNESIUM CHLORIDE OIL
Magnesium oil has been shown to be more effective than supplements in increasing levels in the body due to its ability to be absorbed through the skin.
Magnesium plays an important role in metabolizing carbohydrates, while influencing the activity of hormones that control blood glucose levels. Low magnesium can cause insulin resistance, which could result in the kidneys being unable to retain magnesium during periods of hyperglycaemia, creating a magnesium deficiency and subsequently, diabetes.
A lack of magnesium - which helps regulate the activity of more than 300 enzymes in the body - can contribute to high blood pressure, hyperactivity, heart problems and other health issues.
JUNIPER ESSENTIAL OIL
A potent anti-inflammatory and detoxifying essential oil that can boost the immune system.
Has been shown to increase circulation, increase urine and toxin elimination, heal skin conditions and has strong antiseptic properties.","Organic Magnesium Chloride

The dry skin experts at BIODERMA have formulated the
first dry body oil with the benefits of AHA
. With a two-tiered action on
rough, dry and scaly skin
, Atoderm 2-in-1 Oil works on the surface and deeply within the skin to smooth and strengthen. Containing just 13 ingredients, it has the perfect balance between luxurious sensoriality and high dermatological efficacy, providing lasting hydration and immediate comfort
without a greasy or sticky finish
.
• Jojoba and karanja oils combined with ceramide 3 and squalane provide the skin with biomimetic lipids to
intensely moisturise and strengthen the skin barrier
.
• AHA malic acid ester
regulates surface skin shedding
associated with dry, scaly skin. The gentle effect of this AHA ester means the skin texture is smoothed without irritation, resulting in a soft and satiny touch.
• Dry touch finish provides the ability to
immediately dress after application
with no sticky feeling or the risk of staining your clothing. This is thanks to a polymer of plant origin that balances the nourishing power of the oils by making them easier to spread and giving the texture a light touch.

Atoderm 2-in-1 Oil contains a light, hypoallergenic fragrance to improve product usage, enhancing the sensorial experience. All NAOS fragrances are safe for sensitive skin and have undergone rigorous testing and analysis to ensure they are free from allergens and are perfectly defined, traceable and reproducible.

The Jojoba Company Australian Jojoba 85ml,$34.95,4.7,28,"The one-of-a-kind Australian skincare product that is transforming skin all over the world.

Jojoba is unlike any oil, because it’s not one. It’s the only plant to store liquid wax in its seeds. Sharing the same molecular structure as the natural wax esters found in healthy human skin, making it more receptive to receive vital nutrients and antioxidants, restoring balance, and helping your skin behave as it was always designed to do. That's why jojoba is the heart of our facial oil collection.

How To Use
There are a variety of ways to use Australian Jojoba, including to nourish the skin, hair and nails:

Jojoba For Face
Apply a few drops to your face after yours serums but before your moisturiser. You can even mix Jojoba with your moisturiser for an extra shot of hydration. Use alongside your facial roller or gua sha tool to massage and depuff the face.

Jojoba For Body
Apply Jojoba to damp skin post-shower and massage in circular motions for a boost of hydration and skin suppleness. Use on its own or mix into your favourite body lotion or cream for extra nourishment.

Jojoba For Hair
Apply a few drops of Jojoba to your conditioner to add extra nourishment to dry ends. Apply Jojoba from roots to tips and leave on the hair as a pre-shampoo treatment overnight. Apply to any dry ends, brows or even beard to lock in moisture, de-frizz and add major shine.

Jojoba For Nails
Apply Jojoba to your cuticles to nourish the skin and encourage a longer-lasting manicure.

Jojoba For Bath
Add a couple of drops of Jojoba into your bath to use as a nourishing bath oil.

This product is pregnancy safe however we always recommend consulting your healthcare professional prior to use.

Made with aloe vera and ultra-hydrating lipids, Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion refreshes and soothes dry, dehydrated skin - for a difference you can feel. Daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity and sun) can cause your skin's natural moisture barrier to break down, allowing water to escape the skin.

This body moisturiser is clinically tested to provide 88% more moisture (vs untreated skin). With a soft, refreshing fragrance, it absorbs fast without leaving any residue or greasy feel to relieve everyday dryness and irritation. Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion on dry, dehydrated skin to leave it stronger and noticeably healthier looking. Simply apply to your skin, preferably after a shower, and enjoy up to 48 hours of moisture. This Vaseline lotion bottle is made from 50% recycled plastic. Vaseline has a range of moisturisers to help restore, soothe and nourish all skin types. We believe skin care is essential for well-being.

Using a combination of hyaluronic acids and skin barrier-strengthening ingredients, Hydrabio Hyalu+ Serum targets the source of dehydration to promote the skin's natural hydration and reduce fine lines while boosting skin elasticity. Using BIODERMA's Ecobiological approach of understanding the skin's natural ecosystem and biology, the skin-identical active ingredients in the formula are automatically accepted by the skin, leaving it feeling hydrated, revived, supple and radiant.
• The smaller size of low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid penetrates deeper into the skin, promoting rehydration and plumping fine lines. The skin retains more water for lasting results.
• The larger size of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid forms a protective barrier on the surface of the skin to hydrate from the outside and prevent excess water loss.
• Carnosine uses antioxidant power to protect against oxidative stress. Oxidative stress contributes to the degradation of the skin's natural hyaluronic acid and collagen.
• Strengthens the skin barrier using niacinamide to further prevent excess water loss.
• Non-greasy. Non-sticky. 0% alcohol. 0% silicone.

Bioderma Hydrabio H2O Hydrating Micellar Water Cleanser for Dehydrated Skin 250ml,$19.99,4.7,98,"Hydrating micellar water cleanser with moisturising properties for dehydrated, sensitive skin.
92% OF POLLUTION PARTICLES REMOVED*
25% INCREASE IN HYDRATION AFTER 8HRS**
---
Hydrabio H2O is the cleansing, moisturising micellar water cleanser with BIODERMA's Aquagenium™ patent. From BIODERMA’s research labs, this innovative patent lastingly retrains the skin by promoting the natural production of skin lipids and stimulates the natural water channels within the skin, which are essential for water circulation and promoting water retention in the epidermal layers. The micelles in this formula cleanse the face and eyes, and remove makeup at the same time.
• Apple seed extract and niacinamide make up the Aquagenium™ patent to generate immediate and long-lasting hydration by helping to relaunch the skin's natural hydration while strengthening the barrier function to prevent further water loss.
• Rapeseed further strengthens the skin barrier to help prevent excess water loss, a cause of dehydration.
• Glycerin draws water to the skin's surface from the surrounding environment.
• PEG-6 is the single cleansing agent that makes up the micelles within the formula. PEG-6 was specifically chosen for its skin-identical structure to the skin's hydrolipdic film and for cleansing efficacy. This perfect affinity to the skin and the decision to use only one surfactant provides the ultimate respect for the skin barrier.
• Patented DAF™ complex helps strengthen the skin's tolerance threshold against triggers

Hydrabio H2O contains a light, hypoallergenic fragrance to improve product usage, enhancing the sensorial experience.

Our collagen peptides, along with the other ingredients in our powerful formula, help to lock in moisture, redensify and retighten skin. Niacinamide - Also known as Vitamin B3, this essential nutrient helps to brighten skin and minimise the visible appearance of age spots.   VISIBLE RESULTS After 1 use, skin is intensely rehydrated and nourished.  After 4 weeks, skin feels stronger, denser and contours appear more toned.

Atoderm Crème Ultra nourishes and protects the skin from harsh external stress. Its intentionally simple formula ensures a high tolerance for normal to dry, sensitive skin.
• The Skin Protect™ complex containing niacinamide and a combination of two biomimetic sugars recreates a healthy skin barrier and helps maintain the skin’s water reserves, thus making the skin comfortable again.
• Niacinamide helps to lastingly replenish the skin barrier, which improves the skin's suppleness and durably restores comfort.
• The combination of sugars optimises the skin’s water reserves and encourages the skin's natural water circulation. This action encourages the preservation of hyaluronic acid to provide deep, continuous hydration.
•The presence of glycerin and pharmaceutical-grade mineral oil helps correct the lack of skin hydration by capturing water outside of the body and strengthening the hydrolipidic film.
• Patented DAF™ complex helps strengthen the skin's tolerance threshold against triggers

With a soft, refreshing fragrance, this rich moisturiser absorbs fast without leaving any residue or greasy feel to relieve everyday dryness and irritation.
Daily exposure to environmental triggers (like wind, lack of humidity and sun) can cause your skin's natural moisture barrier to break down, allowing water to escape the skin.

This body moisturiser is clinically tested to provide 88% more moisture (vs untreated skin). Use this dermatologist-tested body lotion on dry, dehydrated skin to leave it stronger and noticeably healthier looking. Simply apply to your skin, preferably after a shower, and enjoy up to 48 hours of moisture.

Bioderma Hydrabio H2O Hydrating Micellar Water Cleanser for Dehydrated Skin 100ml,$10.99,4.6,89,"Cleansing micellar water with moisturising properties for dehydrated, sensitive skin.
92% OF POLLUTION PARTICLES REMOVED*
25% INCREASE IN HYDRATION AFTER 8HRS**
*Study on 33 volunteers aged 18 to 67, with dry skin. **Double-blind trial on 10 volunteers aged 25 to 63, with dry or moderately hydrated skin, for 8 hours.
Hydrabio H2O is the first cleansing, moisturising and makeup removing micellar water with the Aquagenium™ patent. From BIODERMA’s research labs, this innovative patent
lastingly retrains the skin
by promoting the natural production of skin lipids and
stimulates the natural water channels
within the skin which are essential for water circulation and promotes water retention in the epidermal layers. The micelles in this formula cleanse the face and eyes, and remove makeup at the same time.
• Apple seed extract and niacinamide make up the Aquagenium™ patent to
generate immediate and long-lasting hydration
by biologically relaunching the skin's natural water channels and stimulating the production of lipids within the skin barrier.
• Rapeseed further
stimulates lipid production
to strengthen the barrier function and prevent trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), a cause of dehydration.
• Glycerin draws water to the skin's surface from the surrounding environment.
• PEG-6 is the single cleansing agent that makes up the micelles within the formula. PEG-6 was specifically chosen for its biomimetic structure which has a similar composition to the skin's hydrolipdic film and cleansing efficacy. This
perfect affinity to the skin
and the decision to use only one surfactant provides the
ultimate respect for the skin barrier.
The DAF™ patented complex made up of biomimetic sugars soothes, hydrates, protects and increases the skin’s tolerance threshold. Hydrabio H2O leaves skin soft, comfortable and radiant.
Hydrabio H2O contains a light, hypoallergenic fragrance to improve product usage, enhancing the sensorial experience. All NAOS fragrances are safe for sensitive skin and have undergone rigorous testing and analysis to ensure they are free from allergens and are perfectly defined, traceable and reproducible.
